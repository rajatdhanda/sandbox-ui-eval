# Handover: Delete Issue Fix
# Path: docs/handover-delete-fix.md
# Date: July 14, 2025

## Issue Summary
Delete operations were getting stuck at "DELETE_INITIATED" in the UI despite working correctly in backend.

## Root Cause
React Native's `Alert.alert()` wasn't working properly in web browser environment. The confirmation dialog was blocking the delete process.

## Solution Implemented
Modified `hooks/use-crud.ts` to use `window.confirm()` for web environments:

```typescript
// In handleDelete function
if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.confirm) {
  const confirmed = window.confirm('Delete item?');
  if (confirmed) performDelete(item);
} else {
  Alert.alert(...); // Fallback for mobile
}
Current State
✅ Delete works in all tabs
✅ Both soft and hard delete functional
✅ Proper error handling
✅ Success messages displayed
Test Results

Direct Supabase delete: ✅ Working
DB Service delete: ✅ Working
UseCrud hook delete: ✅ Working (after fix)

Files Modified

hooks/use-crud.ts - Fixed handleDelete function
app/(tabs)/test.tsx - Added debug interface (KEEP THIS)

Files to Delete
None currently - test.tsx should remain for ongoing debugging
Next Steps

Monitor delete operations across all tabs
Add similar window.confirm handling for other alerts if needed
Consider adding a custom confirmation modal component

Testing Checklist

 Create a record
 Delete via UI - should show browser confirm dialog
 Verify record is soft deleted (is_active = false)
 Check console for proper logs
 Refresh list to confirm deletion

Important Notes

The delete ALWAYS worked in backend, issue was only UI confirmation
app/(tabs)/test.tsx is now our standard debugging interface
Keep monitoring for similar Alert-related issues on web

Debug Commands
bash# Test delete directly
npx tsx scripts/test-delete-direct.ts

# Check Supabase connection
npx tsx scripts/test-supabase-connection.ts
Lessons Learned

React Native components may not work properly in web environment
Always test CRUD operations at multiple levels (direct, service, hook)
Console logging is crucial for debugging async operations
Having a dedicated test page saves significant debugging time
